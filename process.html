            I always start with research and discovery. What is the problem we're facing? What are our users' pain points and use cases? What are the business goals? How does the current landscape of the market look like? This phase involves capturing insights from desk research, competitor analysis, and stakeholder interviews. I use this information to identify current user behavior and generate ideas for potential solutions.

        </h2>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            Next, I take the insights gathered in the previous phase to define the  product strategy, scope of work, system limitation and dependency, resource and time needed, and success measures. I explore potential design solutions via user flows and interactive prototypes. Defining design principles and documenting design decisions happens here. Sharing design solutions and rationale with key stakeholders is crucial in this phase to ensure alignment across teams and obtain feedback as early as possible.

            <span class="stylized-number">03</span>Correct the dots
        </h2>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            Now it's time for peer review, stakeholder review, and technical feasibility review through design critiques, stakeholder feedback sessions, and usability tests with users. High-fidelity mockups, show and tells, and rapid iterations happen in this phase to refine and improve the product.
        </p>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            Once my team and I reach a solution we're confident is the best (with known information), I work closely with engineering and QA to ensure accuracy of content and that the designs are implemented with the necessary level of finesse. I also help with launch management such as async communication and product documentation of new features.

        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            I believe that design is an ongoing process and has no definitive finish line. After launching a new feature or initiative, my team and I focus on making incremental improvements to the product based on data-driven insights and feedback from users and stakeholders. We use user feedback and usage data to identify areas of the product that can be improved and optimized, making it faster, more efficient, and easier to use.

                Do these four phases resonate with you? I'm always curious to hear about other designers and their process to learn what works well and what could be improved. If you would like to continue this discussion, please feel free to <a href="/#contact">reach out</a> to me and let's chat!
