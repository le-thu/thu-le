        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            Before I begin any project or initiative, I always start with research and discovery. I focus on understanding the problem we're facing, user needs, business goals, and the current landscape of the market. This involves capturing insights from desk research, competitor analysis, and stakeholder interviews. I use this information to identify current user behavior and generate ideas for potential solutions.
        </p>

            <span class="stylized-number">02</span>Connect the dots
        </h2>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            In this phase, I take the insights gathered in the previous phase and define the strategy, scope of work, system limitation and dependency, resource and time needed, and success measures. I explore potential design solutions via low to medium-fidelity mockups, user flows, and setting up structures and format. I also document design decisions and conduct content exploration and UX writing. Sharing design solutions and rationale with key stakeholders is crucial in this phase to ensure alignment across teams and obtain feedback.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title_process">
            <span class="stylized-number">03</span>Correct the dots
        </h2>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            This next phase in my process involves peer review, stakeholder review, and technical feasibility review through design critiques and stakeholder feedback sessions. High-fidelity mockups, show and tells, and rapid iterations happen in this phase to refine and improve the design solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            Once we reach a solution we're confident is the best (with known information), I work closely with engineering and QA to ensure accuracy of content and that the designs are implemented with the necessary level of finesse. I also help with launch management such as internal communication of new features.

        </h2>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            I believe that design is an ongoing process and has no definitive finish line. After the launch, my team and I focus on making incremental improvements to the product based on data-driven insights and feedback from users and stakeholders. We analyze user behavior and usage data to identify areas of the product that can be optimized, making it faster, more efficient, and easier to use.
        </p>
        <p class="stylized-paragraph">
            Through continuous iterations, I strive to make the product better and better over time, always keeping my eye on the goal of providing the best possible experience for users and also meeting the needs of the business.

                Do these four phases resonate with you? I'm always curious to hear about other designers and their process to learn what works well and what could be improved. If you would like to continue this discussion, please feel free to <a href="/#links">reach out</a> to me and let's chat!
